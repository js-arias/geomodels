# EarthByte Model

This model is imported from the *EaarthByte* model,
that is the default model included in [GPlates](https://www.gplates.org/).
The original model can be downloaded
from the [EarthByte page](https://www.earthbyte.org/gplates-2-3-software-and-data-sets/).

## Pixelation

The pixelation has 360 pixels in the equatorial latitude ring.
It is based on the continental polygons,
extended with the volcanic provinces from Johansson et al. (2018).
It is stored in the file `pixels-earthbyte.tab`.

## Rotation

The rotation model was the model compiled by the EarthByte group,
and the main references are:
Torsvik et al. 2019;
Young et al. 2019;
Müller et al. 2019;
Cao et al. 2022;
See that papers for additional references of the different rotations.

The model is stored in the file `geomod-earthbyte.tab`.

## Paleogeography

The 'ocean plateau' layers are just the tectonic features
pixelated at each time.

The model is stored in the file `timepix-earthbyte.tab`.

## Time frame

The rotations are defined from 410 million years to today,
in time stages of 5 million years.
